Sergey Rushev
Junior PHP Developer

Profile

I actually set up my career in the domain of front-end development, which eventually brought me into web design in software development companies, both full-time and project-based vocation. My professional responsibilities amounted to creating dynamic web banners (HTML5), video clips, illustrations and HTML coding.
Now that I understood this domain appeals to me more than design, I have made my mind to get back into development.
I am looking forward to finding a job in a well-established company with a developed onboarding procedure and a chance to learn from seasoned mentors.

Skills: PHP, SQL, Laravel (basis), JS, HTML, CSS, Git.
